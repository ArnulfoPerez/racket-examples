# racket-examples
A set of example apps, mostly created to help me learn Racket.

Contents:

* `learn-music` -- learn to read music with the guitar. Read more on my blog: http://ericclack.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/learn-to-read-music-with-racket-scheme.html

* `stars` -- experiments with very basic 3d graphics, including stars and aliens with random 3d paths.

Many of the app filenames have numbers, these indicate major changes -- 
so it's easy to look back at previous, simpler versions.
